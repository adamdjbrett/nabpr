In cooperation with the National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion (NABPR), Central Seminary is pleased to welcome **Anna Wells** as a Visiting Fellow in August 2024. Identified by NABPR as an excellent emerging scholar in the field of World Christianity, Ms. Wells is the first recipient of the organization's two-year Postdoctoral Fellowship. The fellowship provides valuable experience for new scholars, while also affording the opportunity of fresh connection and engagement for the host institution. Ms. Wells will join Central Seminary after completing her Ph.D. at Baylor University in August 2024.

President Pam Durso noted, "I am delighted by and grateful for the opportunity to partner with NABPR in this new Postdoctoral Fellowship program, the timing of which corresponds beautifully with Central's recent future-oriented initiatives.  We have committed to evaluating our educational delivery, right sizing our space, creating new and relevant programs, and better resourcing our students. The addition of a young scholar and classroom teacher to our faculty and our support of her vocational development fits well into the forward-thinking vision we have at Central. On a more personal note, I am thrilled to welcome Anna to Central and am excited for our students who will experience her intellectual curiosity and her enthusiasm for classroom teaching."
