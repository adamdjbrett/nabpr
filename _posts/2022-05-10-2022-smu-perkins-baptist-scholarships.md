**BAPTIST STUDENTS VIE TO BE PART OF PERKINS’ FIRST  
BAUGH SCHOLARS COHORT**

_Recent gift awarded to the school’s Baptist House of Studies will award up to 10 full scholarships to selected master’s, Doctor of Ministry or Doctor of Pastoral Music Degree students._

**DALLAS (SMU)** – Applications from Baptist students are now being accepted for Fall 2022 for the Baugh Scholars Program, administered by the Perkins School of Theology Baptist House of Studies. Approximately 10 full scholarships – including tuition and fees – will be awarded to qualified applicants who meet the criteria.

The Baugh Scholars Program is made possible through a $2.7 million, three-year grant from the Eula Mae and John Baugh Foundation, a Texas-based philanthropy committed to supporting the work of faith-based, nonprofit organizations. The grant was awarded to the Baptist House of Studies earlier this year.

The contribution will fund full-time Baugh Scholars enrolled in Perkins master’s, Doctor of Ministry and Doctor of Pastoral Music degree programs. [Read more about the Baugh grant](https://www.smu.edu/Perkins/News/News_Archives/Archives_2022/2022-Baugh-Foundation).

Applicants who have demonstrated a vocational commitment and potential to enhance Baptist life through pastoral leadership or teaching will be considered for Baugh Scholarships. As enrolled students in the degree programs offered at Perkins School of Theology at SMU, they are also expected to engage with and contribute to Baptist life at Perkins.
