## [**Mercer Commentary on the Bible**](#mercer)

Watson E. Mills & Richard F. Wilson, general editors This one-volume commentary on the entire Bible distinguishes itself as a leading work in biblical studies. It is the first one-volume commentary based on the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible. It covers the complete Bible, including the apocryphal/deutercanonical books. The Mercer Commentary includes introductory articles on the nature of Scripture, its interpretation, and its role in theology and church. The intended audience is students engaged in Bible study, ministers seeking clear and concise treatment of texts, and laypersons involved in personal and group study; the Mercer Commentary should also be helpful for professionals in various theological disciplines.
