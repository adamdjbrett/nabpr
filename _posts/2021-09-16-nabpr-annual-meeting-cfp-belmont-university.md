## Call for Papers

National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion

Annual Meeting

Belmont University

Nashville, TN

May 23 – 25, 2022

The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion (NABPR) invites paper proposals in any area pertaining to scholarship in Religion. In an effort to develop innovative conversations among scholars, papers that create integration between traditional disciplines or broaden the margins of disciplinary conversations are encouraged. Although many NABPR members work primarily in the traditional disciplines of Biblical Studies, Church History, Theology, etc., proposals are encouraged from any field, including Ministry Studies.

Paper or panel proposals on any aspect of pedagogy related to the teaching of Religion are encouraged.

Graduate students are encouraged to submit proposals. Graduate students must register for the meeting, but the cost is waived, regardless of whether a paper is proposed. 

New proposals must be received by January 15, 2022\. Proposals should include the name(s) and contact information of the presenter(s), title of the presentation, preferred discipline, and 300-word abstract. Submit proposals electronically to:

Dr. Barry Jones
**jonesb[@]campbell[.]edu**

Papers will be scheduled into a 30-minute time period, including discussion.
Proposals will be accepted or denied by March 1, 2022.
