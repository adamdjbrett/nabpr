The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion's Region at Large is accepting papers on the theology of vulnerability and flourishing from a baptistic perspective. Questions include the following:

-   Does God suffer? Does God display vulnerability? What does God intend for human flourishing? Proposals are possible either as a general theological or biblical explorations, but also may involve reflecting how Baptist theologians and biblical scholars have explored these questions.Â 
-   How have Baptists failed to protect vulnerable persons? On the other hand, how have Baptists contributed to practices of human flourishing? Proposals may involve analyses on ecclesial theology and practice in Baptist churches, investigations into past and present abuse in Baptist communities (such as the recent scandals in the Southern Baptist Convention), or reflections on politics and the church's witness from a baptistic framework.
-   What is the role of vulnerability and flourishing in Christian faith and spirituality? Proposals may be reflections on classic themes of the Christian life such as prayer, worship, salvation, sanctification, etc., but also contemporary applications on issues such as gender, sexuality, race, economics, politics, etc.

This section is willing to consider proposals on other topics, but priority will be given to those that fit best with conference themes. Please email proposals to both Spencer Boersma and Amy Chilton by December 15, 2023. Proposals should be 250-500 words and include the presenter's name, instructional affiliation, and contact information. Notification of acceptance will occur on January 15^th^, 2024.
