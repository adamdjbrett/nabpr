## Â Joining NABPR

Anyone interested in joining the National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion [may register via our portal](http://member.nabpr.org/).

### Categories for Membership:

The constitution of the NABPR identifies the following categories of membership, Member, Retired Member, Associate Member, and Student Member.

Voting membership shall be open to any person who qualifies in one of two categories: Member or Retired Member.

  * **Member Status**: Persons holding teaching appointments who are engaged in the teaching of religion or related subjects at accredited colleges, universities, seminaries, or divinity schools may apply for Member status in the Association. Applications for membership shall be referred to the Executive Committee for review. The Executive Committee will report on and recommend candidates for membership to the Association in any annual meeting. The Association will vote upon each candidate for membership.
  * **Retired Member Status**: Persons retired from teaching appointments who were engaged in the teaching of religion or related subjects at accredited colleges, universities, seminaries, or divinity schools may apply for Retired Member status in the Association. Applications for retired membership shall be referred to the Executive Committee for review.

Members in good standing at the time of their retirement need not re-apply for Retired Member status.

Non-voting membership shall be open to any person who does not qualify for Member or Retired Member status. Two categories of non-voting membership are possible: Associate Member and Student Member.

The Association will vote upon each candidate for associate membership.

## Dues Schedule
The official dues schedule for NABPR is below. In 1992 an income based dues structure was adopted and this model had been used for over twenty-five years.  It had never been updated for inflation, and it was always difficult to know exactly how much your dues should be.  Thus, a change was requested, and an ad hoc Committee reviewed the dues structure.  After much, deliberation and voting upon the dues structure at the May 2019 meeting the new revised flat rate dues structure passed and has been implemented as of October 3, 2019. Hopefully this clarified dues structure will be easier for everyone to use. _Thank you so much for your support of NABPR. Due to your generosity, we are able to fund NABPR initiatives, such as our journal, Perspectives in Religious Studies, the NABPR Dissertation Scholarship, the November meeting with AAR/SBL, and the Annual May meeting. we sincerely appreciate your willingness to join and renew membership to our organization._
