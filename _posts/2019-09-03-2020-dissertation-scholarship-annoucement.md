The NABPR is committed to supporting academically qualified scholars and teachers of religion for the Baptist academy who carry out their teaching and research with a sense of Baptist identity.  The particular purpose of the [NABPR dissertation scholarship](/dissertation/) is to foster conversations about what it means to be a Baptist teacher and scholar in relationship to church and academy, thus contributing to the formation of students in a Baptist tradition and the support of important research by Baptist doctoral students.

One scholarship of $3,000 will be awarded each year.  Recipients will also be given a travel stipend to attend the National [NABPR](/) meeting in the year the award is granted. They will be recognized by the association in the business session where they will offer a brief overview of their research.  Recipients may also be invited to attend subsequent workshops on Baptists and higher education.

In order to be eligible the candidate must be:

  *   at the dissertation stage (ABD) of his/her program in an accredited doctoral program,
  *   affiliated or connected in an ongoing way with some Baptist congregation,
  *   a student member of NABPR (which applicants may join at the time of application with no penalty),
  *   nominated by a faculty member of NABPR who agrees by virtue of the nomination to serve as the student’s mentor.

To apply the candidate must submit the following:

  *   a letter of interest that addresses the following:
  *   the applicant’s Baptist identity, including his or her church involvement
  *   how the funds will be spent,
  *   the applicant’s long term academic goals that demonstrates how their scholarship is related to and/or benefits the Baptist church
  *   a _curriculum vitae_,
  *   the dissertation prospectus,
  *   two letters of recommendation (one of which may be the nomination mentioned above).

All materials must be submitted electronically to Dr. Daniel Mynatt, National Executive Secretary of NABPR, at [dmynatt@umhb.edu](mailto:dmynatt@umhb.edu) by January 15, 2020.

Candidates will be evaluated on the strength of their application materials by members of the [NABPR Dissertation Scholarship Committee](/dissertation/). Preference will be given to candidates who have been active participants in NABPR as evidenced by their attendance and/or presentations at meetings.
