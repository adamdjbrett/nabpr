### Kathryn House

Kathryn House is a PhD candidate in Practical Theology at Boston University School of Theology. Her dissertation reconsiders theologies of salvation in light of intersections of race, gender, and sexuality in US-American evangelical campaigns for sexual purity. She examines the soteriological impulses of the Moral Reform movement, of racial terror lynchings related to allegations of sexual assault, and of abstinence-only sex education initiatives in the 1990s. Interrogating the wedding of whiteness and purity in these campaigns, Kathryn queries the possibility of baptism as a counter-practice to the implications of these intertwined symbolics. Her previous publications include “Torture and Lived Religion: Practices of Resistance” in _Trauma and Lived Religion_ (Palgrave Macmillan, forthcoming 2018) and &#8220;Sometimes, the Minister is a Girl,&#8221; in _Faithfully Feminist: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Feminists on Why We Stay_ (White Cloud Press, 2015).

Kathryn is ordained in the Alliance of Baptists and American Baptist Churches USA, and is a member of the First Baptist Church in Jamaica Plain. She is currently Assistant Director of the Center for Practical Theology at Boston University School of Theology. She is aunt to Tripp, Margaret Anne, and Charlie, and works diligently to secure their ACC loyalties for Duke despite her brother&#8217;s unfortunate UNC-Chapel Hill allegiances.
