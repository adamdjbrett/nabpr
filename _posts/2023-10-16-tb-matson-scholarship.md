#### **Application Guidelines for T. B. Maston Scholarship in the Study of Christian Ethics**

The T. B. Maston Scholarship is established to honor the life and service of Dr. T. B. Maston.

Dr. Maston helped to birth Baptist Christian Life Commissions, both on the national level and in several of the Baptist state conventions. He influenced thousands of Baptist students to consider the ethical as a concern of the church. He contributed to 27 books on ethics. His influence was key in making it unacceptable for congregations to ignore the needs of the poor, the disenfranchised, the hungry, and the hurting.

Dr. Maston's favorite Scripture verse was *1 John 2:6* -- "Whoever claims to live in Him must walk as Jesus did." *(NIV) *Until his death in 1988, T. B. Maston always challenged himself and others in the Baptist tradition to live out an authentically Christ-like life.
