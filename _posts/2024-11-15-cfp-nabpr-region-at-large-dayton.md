## 2025 NABPR Region-at-Large Meeting (meeting in conjunction with the College Theology Society Annual Meeting)

The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion (NABPR) Region-at-Large welcomes paper proposals for their section of the 2025 CTS Annual Meeting.

### Conference Details:

-   May 29-June 1, 2025
-   University of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio
-   Theme: "The Locus of the Theological Vocation."

### Call for Papers:

Over the past 25 years, many shifts have affected the landscape of theological education. Shrinking institutional resources, reduced religion and theology requirements, and vanishing full-time academic posts have directed many academically trained theologians into other professions, such as ministry and non-profit work. These new professional locations are nonetheless sites for theological development. Additionally, many seminaries and divinity schools have expanded their degree offerings, including shared programs in theology and other fields such as law, social work, and counseling. This diversifies new theologians' formational profile as well as their professional interests. Further concerns and questions have arisen due to the increased use of new media (e.g., podcasts, social media) and the advancing capabilities of artificial intelligence also shape the theological vocation.

While it is difficult to ascertain if this environment is uniquely challenging for those committed to the craft of theology, it is certainly accurate that changes are happening and adaptation is needed.

Related to these observations, this section is interested in proposals related to the following topics:

-   A new public theology emerging as theologians work in new loci
-   Theology developed from new loci
-   Theology residing at the intersection with social concerns
-   Theological reflections about the new loci, their challenges, and their opportunities
-   Reflections on the stance of the church toward these developments

Proposals focused on questions unrelated to the conference theme will also be considered. There is also possibility for virtual/hybrid participation in this section.

Graduate students are especially encouraged to attend and present. Graduate students who attend will be reimbursed for their conference registration fee after the meeting concludes.

Proposals should be 250-500 words in length and include a title, the proposer's institutional affiliation, and any anticipated AV needs. Send proposals to Derek Hatch (<derek_hatch@georgetowncollege.edu>) and Steven Harmon (<sharmon@gardner-webb.edu>) by December 15, 2024. Scholars will be notified of proposal status by the end of January 2025.

Inquiries about the call for proposals can be directed to either of the co-conveners.
