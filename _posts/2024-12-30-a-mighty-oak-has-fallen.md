'A Mighty Oak Has Fallen.â€™ The work of Jimmy Carter, especially his post-presidential efforts for global peace and reconciliation, as well as his active role in Habitat for Humanity, gave many of us a reason to be grateful for our Baptist heritage and hope for its future. We invite all NABPR members and others to read Scott Spencer's timely essay on Carter (and the Woman of Sychar - John 4) in the most recent issue of *Perspectives in Religious Studies* (51.4 Winter).
