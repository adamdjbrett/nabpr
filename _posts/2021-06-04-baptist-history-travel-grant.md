The Angus Library and Archive at Regent’s Park College, University of Oxford, is the leading world-class
collection for the study of Baptist and Nonconformist history and heritage.  The Angus is
connected to the Centre for Baptist Studies, a research centre of Regent’s Park College which aims to
develop research and scholarship in Baptist history and theology and to relate Baptist history and
theology to Baptist life and principles today.

Scholars from all over the world use the Angus Library and Archive for a wide range of research. While
certain items in the collection have been digitised and are available online, the vast majority require
scholars to visit in person to be able to access them.

We are, therefore, delighted to invite applications for the new William H. and Kathryn E. Brackney
Angus Travel Bursary to allow more scholars to access material relevant to their research in
person. During the 2021-2022 academic year, the bursary is worth £750.

**The closing date for applications has now been extended to the 15th of June 2021.**

**If successful applicants are prevented from travelling to the UK due to restrictions put in place as a result of the coronavirus pandemic , the William H. and Kathryn E. Brackney Angus Travel Bursary will be honoured at a subsequent date to be mutually agreed.**
