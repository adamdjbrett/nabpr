**Dissertation Scholarship**

The NABPR is committed to encouraging academically qualified scholars and teachers of religion who carry out their teaching and research with a sense of Baptist identity.  To that end, the NABPR dissertation scholarship supports emerging scholars in their academic journeys and supports new research, especially research that impacts the Baptist tradition.

One scholarship of $3,000 will be awarded each year.  In addition, recipients can receive two separate travel stipends in the amount of $1,000 to attend the May meeting and/or $1,000 to attend the November AAR/SBL meeting of the NABPR, where their work will be recognized by the association. 

In order to be eligible the candidate must be:

- at the dissertation stage (ABD) in an accredited doctoral program

- affiliated with a Baptist congregation

- an NABPR member - applicants may join (at a discounted student membership rate) at the time of application with no penalty

To apply the candidate must submit the following:

-   a letter of interest, including potential use of the funds (for example: childcare, living expenses, research costs, or travel for research purposes),
-   a *curriculum vitae*,
-   the dissertation prospectus and/or sample chapter,
-   two letters of recommendation, one of which must be from a member of the NABPR

**All materials must be submitted electronically to Dr. Adam C. English, Executive Secretary/Treasurer of NABPR, at <englisha@campbell.edu> **
