## **National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion**

**Greetings  from  the  NABPR  Executive Secretary-Treasurer**

      The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas! The boldness of this meeting befits its location. With help from the Baugh Foundation, we have convened a tremendous array of experts to inform our plenary sessions on the topic of clergy abuse, the courage to break the silence, address it, and reform. For that reason alone, this meeting represents an important milestone for our organization.

    All three organizations worked together closely and with Baylor University to create the program -- it was laborious but so rewarding! I am energized by the collaborative nature of this meeting. It offers a chance to encounter new ideas, meet upcoming scholars, and renew old friendships.

    NABPR President João Chaves managed proposals and program assignments for NABPR. Our local contacts, at least from the NABPR side, were primarily João Chaves, Mandy McMichael, and Heather Starkey, without whom there would be no meeting. Many other hands contributed, and they should all be thanked!

Adam  C.  English

Executive  Secretary-Treasurer

## Association of Ministry Guidance Professionals
### Greetings from the AMGP Executive Director-Treasurer

Welcome to the AMGP 2025 Annual Meeting. Our meeting again this year is held in conjunction with the annual meetings of our colleagues in the NABPR and BHHS. I want to thank all those at Baylor for hosting us this year. Heather Starkey, Administrative Assistant for Ministry Guidance, has been most helpful in making all the logistical arrangements for the meeting. I also want to thank Adam English (NABPR) and Aaron Weaver (BHHS) for their leadership and collegiality in working together with me and our AMGP President, Lisa Seeley in planning this year’s program. The practical and moral focus of this year’s plenary sessions is particularly pertinent to AMGP. 
Founded in 1959, AMGP is made up of Baptist theological educators responsible for guiding students through ministerial call clarification and supervised field experiences in ministry. We provide a forum for sharing information and establishing professional standards for ministry guidance. 

The issue of clergy abuse is particularly pertinent for our organization. The has never been a greater need for congregational awareness and vigilance, moral and behavioral instruction for ministry leaders, and practices of prevention by all concerned. 

Bill Carrell
Executive Director-Treasurer

## Baptist History and Heritage Society
Greetings from the BHHS Executive Director

Welcome to Waco and to the 2025 joint annual conference of the Baptist History & Heritage Society! We are grateful for our partnership with NABPR and AMGP. Thank you to Adam English and Bill Carrell for their collaboration and collegiality! 

A special word of gratitude to the Baylor University Department of Religion for hosting us, to Heather Starkey for coordinating local arrangements, and to BHHS President Mandy McMichael for her leadership planning this gathering. 

Founded in 1938, BHHS helps Baptists discover, conserve, assess and share their history while bridging the worlds of the academy and the congregation through publications, conferences, and resources for ministers, laity, academics, and students. 

Since 1969, BHHS has sponsored an annual meeting to explore diverse themes and topics related to Baptist history and identity. We are honored to have 27 presenters sharing their research and insights with us! 

This year’s focus on addressing abuse in Baptist communities provides a forum for courageous conversations about a pressing challenge in Baptist life—a reminder that abuse is part of the Baptist story. I look forward to learning together this week. Thank you for being here!
   
Aaron Weaver
Executive Director
