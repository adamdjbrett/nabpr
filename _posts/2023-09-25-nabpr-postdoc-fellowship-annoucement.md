The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion (NABPR) invites applications for its inaugural **Postdoctoral Fellowship**. We hope that this Postdoctoral Fellowship will deepen the fellow's commitments to emerging Baptist scholarship and provide vital experience for fellow's as they continue to navigate the job market. This two-year fellowship will take place from Fall 2024 until Spring 2026. The selected candidate will be placed at an accredited host institution with job responsibilities divided among teaching, research, and administration (This division will be negotiated with the host institution, candidates, and NABPR). Conversations with potential host institutions are ongoing and placement will be made in collaboration with candidates.

To apply, interested candidates should prepare a cover letter, cv, and the names and contact information for three references. Cover letters should address the candidate's 1) teaching experience and interests, 2) research agenda for the following two years, and 3) relationship to the Baptist tradition. NABPR welcomes applications from across a wide range of disciplines including but not limited to: Systematic Theology, Comparative Theology, Practical Theology, Historical Studies, Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Ethics, and World Religions. We also seek a diverse candidate pool and welcome applications from individuals from underrepresented groups in the academy. Candidates are not required to be members of NABPR to apply, but should be able to describe their relationship to the Baptist tradition.

Compensation: This position will receive a yearly salary of $47,500. In addition fellows will receive $2,500 for conference travel which must include either the NABPR's Annual Meeting in May or NABPR's gathering at the American Academy of Religion in November. Benefits will be provided by the candidate's host institution.

Depending upon the host institution, fellows may be required to relocate in which case the fellows will be responsible for their own housing for the duration of the fellowship.

Questions and application materials can be directed to Dr. Andrew Gardner (<agardner@lagrange.edu>)

Review of applications will begin on December 1st and will continue until the position is filled. |
