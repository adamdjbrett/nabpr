Husezo Rhakho is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Religion at Baylor University, from Nagaland, India. He holds a BA in History from Patkai Christian College, an MDiv from Kohima Bible College in Nagaland, India, and a ThM in Christian Thought (World Missions/Global Christianity) from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. He studies World Christianity and History of Christian Mission, particularly in Asia. His research interest focuses on the trends and growth of Christianity, Baptists, Revival, and indigenous studies.Â 

My dissertation, titled **"*The Rise of Christianity in India: An Analysis of Naga Christianity as Seen in the Interplay of Baptist and Indigenous Nagaland Christian Revival Church Relations,"*** examines the historical and cultural dimensions of Christianity in Nagaland. It focuses on the interplay between Naga Baptist traditions and the Nagaland Christian Revival Church (NCRC), analyzing key historical events, Indigenous practices, missionary efforts, and lived experiences within these communities from the 1870s to the 1980s. Nagaland was formerly known as the " headhunters, but it was through the American Baptist missionary's effort and the indigenous Christian leaders that led to the tremendous growth of Christianity in Nagaland. Today, almost all Nagas claim to be Christians. This research highlights Nagaland's unique identity as the "most Baptist land on earth. "It contributes to the study of religion and culture by exploring how Christianity shape's identity, community, and resistance. By bridging academic scholarship and lived experiences, my work adds to the broader discourse on the intersection of religion, culture, politics, and identity in World Christianity, particularly Baptist and charismatic traditions.

My analysis also highlights another element of world Christianity narratives: how Western and local religious practices fused and interacted to create a distinct Naga Christian/Baptist story. The NCRC, for example, reacted to the traditional missionary Baptists by drawing inspiration not only from Western charismatic influences but also from elements of local religious traditions, particularly embodied in the emphasis on *"**Ungo Mhathoko***"**(signs and wonders), to add a polycentric dimension to Nagaland Christianity. My study examines the development of these innovative Naga liturgical practices, which includes the tradition of uttering "*Jehova Tshe*" (Praise the Lord) three times, both before and after each prayer, as well as the tripartite model of prayer, encompassing confession of sins, expulsion of demons, and supplication for blessings. These liturgical developments reflect the rich tapestry of religious innovation and adaptation that resulted from the Naga Revival traditions. I have argued that NCRC represents a dynamic indigenization of Christianity, where the Naga world of spirit beliefs and charismatic revivalism converge.

I am very grateful to NABPR for awarding me the [dissertation scholarship](/dissertation/). It is a testament to your commitment and support for emerging scholars and the broader field of academia. I am trully honored to be part of this community.

Best,

Husezo
