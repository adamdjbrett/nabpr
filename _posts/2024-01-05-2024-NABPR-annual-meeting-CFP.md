The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion (NABPR) invites paper and panel proposals for the annual May Meeting, **May 20-22, 2024, First Baptist Church, Raleigh, North Carolina**.  In an effort to develop innovative conversations among scholars, papers and panels that create integration between traditional disciplines or broaden the margins of disciplinary conversations are given priority in scheduling.   Although many NABPR members work primarily in the traditional disciplines of Biblical Studies, Church History, Theology, etc., proposals are welcomed from any field, including Ministry Studies.

 This year's conference is a collaboration between the Association of Ministry Guidance Professionals, the Baptist History and Heritage Society, and the National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion. Each organization is issuing a separate call for papers. Individuals may submit different paper proposals to multiple organizations, but may not submit the same paper or panel proposal to multiple organizations. For individuals submitting multiple papers through multiple organizations, please indicate so when submitting.

 Paper or panel proposals on any aspect of pedagogy related to the teaching of Religion are also encouraged.

 Graduate students are encouraged to submit proposals.  Graduate students must register for the meeting, but the cost will be reduced to a nominal fee, regardless of whether a paper is proposed. In addition, presenting graduate students will be eligible for a travel stipend.

 Proposals must be received by February 15, 2024. Proposals should include the name(s) and contact information of the presenter(s), title of the presentation, preferred discipline, and 300-word abstract. Submit proposals electronically to:

**Dr. Alicia Myers**

**<amyers@campbell.edu>**

Please include "**NABPR Proposal**" in the subject line of your email.

Papers will be scheduled into a 30-minute time period, including discussion.

Proposals will be accepted or denied by March 1, 2024.
