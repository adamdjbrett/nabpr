# Program
## The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion
### Greetings from the NABPR Executive Secretary-Treasurer
Welcome to Raleigh! Let’s express deep appreciation to First Baptist Raleigh, pastor Chris Chapman, chef Troy Dye, and church administrator Wayne Hager, for graciously hosting us. We are also grateful to the Baugh Foundation for a planning grant that has allowed us to offer a special plenary workshop session on Religion in the Media with the BJC, and has allowed us to provide collaborative conversation breakfasts Tuesday and Wednesday. Director of Development Andrew Gardner secured the Baugh grant on our behalf. Thanks to Glenn Jonas of Campbell University, our local contact, and to the planning committee that consisted of representatives from AMGP, BHHS, and NABPR. It has been a joy to dream about this joint meeting for over a year.

Mark your calendars for the November NABPR meeting in San Diego to welcome plenary speaker Ben Cowan of UCSD and NABPR President for 2024-25, João Chaves.

Adam C. English
Executive Secretary-Treasurer


## The Association of Ministry Guidance Professionals
### Greetings from the AMGP Executive Director-Treasurer
Welcome to the 2024 annual meeting of the AMGP. We appreciate NABPR, BHHS, and FBC, Raleigh, for working hard to make this joint meeting possible.
AMGP consists of theological educators responsible for guiding students through ministerial call clarification and supervised field experiences in ministry. We provide a forum for sharing information and establishing professional standards for ministry guidance.

This is our third time to be a part of a joint meeting with other professional organizations. Our members will have the opportunity to attend not only AMGP sessions but also NABPR and BHHS sessions. Following this meeting, Dr. Bill Carrell will assume the role of AMGP Executive Director, and will guide us into the future.

Royce Rose
Executive Director-Treasurer

## The Baptist History and Heritage Society
### Greetings from the BHHS Executive Director
Welcome to the 2024 annual conference of the Baptist History and Heritage Society, held this year in cooperation with our colleagues at the National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion and the Association of Ministry Guidance Professionals. Since 1969, the Society has sponsored an annual meeting in which we have considered a wide variety of themes relating to Baptist history, listened to formal paper presentations, and participated in stimulating panel discussions. This annual conference builds upon that fifty-five-year tradition.
We deeply appreciate the hospitality shown to us by our friends at First Baptist Church, Raleigh, who serves as the official host for this year’s conference. Special thanks go to: Chris Chapman, senior pastor of First Baptist Church, Wayne Hager, church administrator, and chef Troy Dye for their cooperation in planning every aspect of this meeting.

Welcome to Raleigh and to this annual conference. Over the next three days, we will have the opportunity to hear some of the most insightful persons from both inside and outside our denominational life. We are glad that you have joined us.

John Finley 
Executive Director
