Congratulations to NABPR member, Dam Nelson on the publication of his new book _Early Baptists: A Comparative Study of the Anabaptist_ (Faithful Life Publishers, 2022).

## Book Description
My new book&nbsp; _Early Baptists: A Comparative Study of the Anabaptist and English Baptist Movements_ is the product of research regarding the history, biographies, and timelines related to both Early Baptist groups. The book will help you understand how Baptists developed and through much hardship became the sustained and enlarged movement they are today. It is important to understand how the beliefs and practices Baptists hold developed and stood for in these turbulent and even violent times. The stories of sacrifice and martyrdom will inspire you. The doctrinal beliefs distinctive to Baptists and like other groups is related in the doctrinal section with quotes by leaders and confessions. The book itself is a product of intensive research over and year and a half period with 550 pages of over 1000 footnotes, and over 120 sources developed in a chronological process.  You can be selective and read certain biographies of use to you and use it as a teaching tool. You can research certain doctrines early Baptists taught and how they influence us today in the doctrinal section. It will help you understand possibly like you never have before these leaders and happenings in their stand for religious liberty, believer’s baptism, individual conversion, the gathered assembly, and other doctrines that Baptists have suffered and even died for. Reading and studying this book will give you a complete picture of Baptists in the 16th and 17th centuries and how their struggles have shaped us. There are also biographies of Baptists that have evolved from these groups and others not as well-known but no less influential. The book is unique because you are given a thorough understanding of both groups in one volume. Don’t miss this exciting and profitable study.

The retail price on the book is $29.99 but I’m taking $5 off the price in hopes it can be more affordable at $24.99. We do not currently have an ebook out but plan to publish one probably around the first of the year. I can invoice you with an envelope to mail back to me or you can use Paypal if you want to pay through credit card. Just let me know your address and I can mail the book to you.
